* Class definition for a simple matrix, that is optimised for nx4 or 4xn matrices.

* This class is heavily optimised for these commonly used matrices as used in 3D geometry.
* Whilst this class does support basic operations on matrices of any dimension, it is not intended as a
* general purpose matrix class as inversion operations are only provided for 4x4 matrices.
* For programmers needing more flexible Matrix support, the Matrix and MatrixMath classes from
* Ernsesto Palacios provide a good basis:
