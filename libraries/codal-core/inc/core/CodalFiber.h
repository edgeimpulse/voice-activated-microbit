/**
  * Functionality definitions for the Device Fiber scheduler.
  *
  * This lightweight, non-preemptive scheduler provides a simple threading mechanism for two main purposes:
  *
  * 1) To provide a clean abstraction for application languages to use when building async behaviour (callbacks).
  * 2) To provide ISR decoupling for EventModel events generated in an ISR context.
  *
  * TODO: Consider a split mode scheduler, that monitors used stack size, and maintains a dedicated, persistent
  * stack for any long lived fibers with large stack
