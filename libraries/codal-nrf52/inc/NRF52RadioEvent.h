/**
 * Provides a simple broadcast radio abstraction, built upon the raw nrf51822 RADIO module.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to extend the micro:bit's default EventModel to other micro:bits in the vicinity,
 * in a very similar way to the NRF52EventService for BLE interfaces.
 *
 * It is envisaged that this would provide the basis for children to experiment with building their own, simple,
 * custom asynchronous events and actions.
 *
 * @note This API does not contain any form of encryption, authentication or authorisation. Its purpose is solely for use as a
 * teaching aid to demonstrate how simple communications operates, and to provide a sandpit through which learning can take place.
 * For serious applications, BLE should be considered a substantially more secure alternative.
